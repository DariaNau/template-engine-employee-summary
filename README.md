# Template Engine - Employee Summary

## App Description

A Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, it is also ensured that all unit tests pass. The Inquirer npm package is used to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.

##  Business Context

Following the common templates for user stories, we can frame this challenge as follows:  

As a manager  

I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info  

so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
